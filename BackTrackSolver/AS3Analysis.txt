What are our decisions?
Decision:
one decision for every letter of the string
where is the first letter of the string on the board?
all characters on board are options for the first letter in the String
First Decision -> all characters are options
Second Decision -> feasible option is one that is not capitalized and is the next letter in the string
Third Decison -> based off of the 2nd decision
Nth Decision -> will depend on the N-1 decision, must backtrack if no other options are found.
