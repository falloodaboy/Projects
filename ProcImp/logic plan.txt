For the jump/branch/next control mux, the mux should contain all of the calculated values and then new muxes will decide which value goes to the control mux select
pin, thus only that value will be written into the PC.
Check Instruction Decoder to see if it is working properly.
For the J/br/next pri encoder, the first spot represents PC + 1.
made ReadSelect0 and ReadSelect1 Rs and Rt respectively. Is this true in all cases?
need to find a way to shorten Rs or Rt for RAM address
only rs access the data input for RAM
memory only writes to Rs
ALU A needs mux because of branch with immediate
removed the mux with DATARA and ExImm and replaced with DATARA going into ALU A.
changed all output pins in the control so that Three State output is False.
Test jumps and branches, fix the code executing too fast.
