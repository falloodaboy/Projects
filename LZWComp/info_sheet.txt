Additional comments to the grader:
For the monitor mode, the bits compressed would be the size of the longest prefix found which would be W, and the uncompressed would be the size of the
longestPrefix found * 12 for each letter in the longest prefix string. This is because uncompressed would have written a static bitwidth for each ASCII
character. This is how compressed and uncompressed were calculated in the MyLZW file.
