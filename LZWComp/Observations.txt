Compress:
binstdout,write(int x, int r) and readInt(int r) work together using the codeword width to read and write data in bits 
will probably have to use these two methods to vary the width of the codeword from 9 to 16.
still need to maintain R and the string of single chars.

Variability:
Naive attempt would be to simply reset whenever codebook is full for both compression and expansion.
